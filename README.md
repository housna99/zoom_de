# Github codespaces :
GitHub Codespaces is a feature that allows you to create an instant development environment directly within your web browser. With Codespaces, you can develop, build, and debug your code without the need to set up a local development environment on your machine.

Codespaces provides a containerized environment that includes the necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies for your project. It's particularly useful for collaborative development, enabling team members to work on the same project with consistent environments.
